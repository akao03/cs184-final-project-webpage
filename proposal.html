        <h2>Summary</h2>

		This project aims to build a 3D-remake of a 2D cute sex education simulation game, potentially including shaders.

        <h2>Problem Description</h2>

		One of our members, Circle Chen, has built this amazing game called Spermulator from the Spring 2022 Game Design and Development DeCal. The game can be found at this link: <a href="https://circlecly.itch.io/spermulator.">https://circlecly.itch.io/spermulator</a>. This game is a simulation of the journey of a sperm. The player controls a sperm cell and must navigate through various obstacles to reach the egg. The game is designed to be both educational and entertaining, providing players with information about human reproduction while also challenging them to complete the game. <br/>

		While engaging, the game is in 2D, and we would like to remake everything in 3D. This would require applying knowledge on 3D modeling, animation, and potentially shaders.

        <h2>Goals and Deliverables</h2>

		What we plan to deliver is a 3D remake of the Spermulator game hosted on itch.io, where viewers could play this game. The game should run at 60 FPS consistently on a modern laptop. All original game functions should be working.

		If things go well, we will include shaders to enhance the visual experience of the game.

		<!--In this section you should organize and plan the tasks and subtasks that your team will execute. Since presentations are ~4 weeks from the due-date of the proposal, you should include a set of tasks for every week.-->

        <h2>Schedule</h2>

		<p>Recreate Assets in 3D (sperm, cells, map)</p>

		<p>Reprogram controls and game mechanics in 3D</p>

		<p>Shaders if time</p>

		<p>Integration Testing</p>

        <h2>Resources</h2>
		<p>Unity Tutorials</p>
		<p>Shaders, how to use them in Unity.</p>
