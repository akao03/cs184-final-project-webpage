        <p>We have made significant progress towards our goal as of April 20th, 2025. First, we were able to obtain a 3D sperm model 
        and animate it using sine displacement to produce a "swimming" motion. At the same time, we were able to convert the 
        camera view to 3D to simulate 3D movement and add glows to our 3D objects using Bloom filters. We are currently polishing 
        our acidic patches (spheres in the backend) so they can both glow and be transparent. </p>

        <p>The 3D model of the uterus is mostly formed and we are continually revising it before we import it to our game. We 
        have created textures for the uterus and egg. Next steps include creating models and textures for bacteria and
        finalizing those of the egg alongside updating game functionality for 3D. </p>
        
        <p>This short video showcases the new 3D camera view and sperm movement. You may need to open it in a new tab for it to play.</p>

        <p>Here we have our 3D uterus model.</p>
        <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
			  <tr>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="images/milestone/uterus-wip.png" width="400px"/>
				  <figcaption>The full uterus model.</figcaption>
				</td>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="images/milestone/uterus-wip-1.png" width="400px"/>
				  <figcaption>Closeup of a part of the model.</figcaption>
				</td>
			  </tr>
			</table>
		</div>

        <p>These are some textures we will be using in our project.</p>
		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
			  <tr>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="images/milestone/egg-texture.png" width="400px"/>
				  <figcaption>Texture for the egg.</figcaption>
				</td>
				<td style="text-align: center;">

				  <figcaption>Textured uterine wall. This scene will be updated with 3D assets.</figcaption>
				</td>
			  </tr>
			</table>
		</div>

        Overall we are making good progress relative to our plans. Our work plan for the time between now and submission includes the following objectives:
        <ul>
            <li>Modify the sperm movement such that it only plays when the sperm is moving</li>
            <li>Import the finalized uterus model into Unity and integrate it with existing 3D assets (including proper scaling and lighting)</li>
            <li>Update any other areas (e.g. logic) such that the player can go through the level from beginning to end in a smooth manner</li>
          </ul>
