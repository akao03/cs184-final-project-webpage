		<h2>Abstract</h2>
		<!--A paragraph summary of the entire project-->
		In this project, we turned Spermulator, a 2D game, into 3D.

		<h2>Technical Approach</h2>
		<!--A 1-2 page summary of your technical approach, techniques used, algorithms implemented, etc. 
		(use references to papers or other resources for further detail). Highlight how your approach varied from the 
		references used (did you implement a subset, or did you change or enhance anything), the unique decisions you 
		made and why.-->
		<p>The conversion from 2D to 3D required the creation of new objects for each of the existing 2D assets, including 
			the player sperm, bacteria cells, immune cells, and the uterus itself. 
		</p>
		<p>We primarily experimented with Unity parameters and set up test scenes for visualizing new assets.</p>

		<!--A description of problems encountered and how you tackled them.-->
		<p>We encountered a variety of bugs while working on the project. Initially when doing sine-based displacement on the sperm model,
		the sperm's head would also swing. We fixed this by changing the shader graph to produce spiral-like movement rather than 
		purely side by side. This had the benefit of making a more realistic movement while also keeping the sperm's head relatively stable.
		We also encountered issues with transparency of the acid, namely the spheres representing acid would show up as opaque despite having 
		a color alpha value of zero (i.e. transparent) or it would be semi-transparent but colors of the overlapping shapes would not appear.
		We addressed this by changing the shader used for the acid's material from a shader graph to an unlit transparent shader.</p>
		<p>Another bug that came up was the player model not spawning after the conclusion of the tutorial level.</p>
		<p>Proper movement and interaction with walls proved to be a challenge.</p>

		<!--A description of lessons learned.-->

		<h2>Results</h2>
		<!--Your final images, animations, video of your system (whichever is relevant). 
		You can include results that you think show off what you built but that you did not have time to go over on presentation day.-->

		<!--Include side-by-side comparisons of 2D vs new 3D stuff e.g. player, bacteria cells, egg-->
